Hey Mitch,

 The easiest way to configure your data for CORS is with the gsutil command line tool.
 The installation instructions for gsutil are available at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install.
 Once you've installed gsutil and authenticated with it, you can use it to configure CORS.
 
 For example, if you just want to allow object downloads from your custom domain, put this data in a file named cors.json (replacing "https://example.com" with your domain):
 [
   {
     "origin": ["https://example.com"],
     "method": ["GET"],
     "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
   }
 ]
 
 Then, run this command (replacing "exampleproject.appspot.com" with the name of your bucket):
 gsutil cors set cors.json gs://exampleproject.appspot.com
 
 and you should be set.
 
 If you need a more complicated CORS configuration, check out the docs at https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/cross-origin#Configuring-CORS-on-a-Bucket.
